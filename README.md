### Coder's Creed




### PROBLEM STATEMENT: Low-income immigrants in British Columbia often face significant barriers when searching for affordable housing, including language barriers, lack of access to information, and difficulty navigating the housing market. These challenges can lead to prolonged searches, increased stress, and ultimately, suboptimal housing choices that do not meet their needs or budgets.





### PROPOSED SOLUTION: An AI-based platform, Housing Finder, specifically tailored for low-income immigrants. This platform will leverage an AI-driven recommendation engine to match users with affordable housing options based on their income levels, family size, and proximity to essential services such as schools, healthcare, and public transportation. Furthermore, the platform incorporates a multilingual translation feature, allowing users to browse listings and platform interfaces in their preferred language.
